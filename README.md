## Bloc Jams Angular

jQuery is a great tool for adding animations and effects to a page, but it's difficult to build a sophisticated frontend application with jQuery alone. In this project, I refactored Bloc Jams using AngularJS. I used controllers to control the flow of data in the application, services to organize and share code across the app, and directives to attach specific Angular behavior to DOM elements.
