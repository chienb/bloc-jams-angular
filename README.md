## Bloc Jams Angular

jQuery is a great tool for adding animations and effects to a page, but it's difficult to build a sophisticated frontend application with jQuery alone. In this project, I refactored Bloc Jams using AngularJS. I used controllers to control the flow of data in the application, services to organize and share code across the app, and directives to attach specific Angular behavior to DOM elements.

In addition, d3.js was used to display the number of song plays in a simple <a href="https://blocjamsangular.herokuapp.com/metrics">graph</a>.
